04 Basic Views
  01 Actions And Outlets
    01 Basics (OOP Cards Simple Views)
    02 Passing Data Between VCs (This Button is Epoch)
    03 Getting More Comfortable (Objc Blackjack Views)
    04 More Practice (Jukebox Views)
    05 ADV: Understanding Frames (OOP Cards Views)
  02 Segues & Nav Controllers
    01 Xcode: Simulated Metric Size
    rr multiple VCs and Modal Segues  ?Wed?
    ll modal based lab                ? Wed?
    rr Nav Controllers & Show Segues (terms: show/push)
         drill in modal vs push conceptually. Show segue is adaptive now: makes a best guess, but if in a Nav stack you can force a modal by selecting it
    01 Intro (Objc Navigation Controllers)
        clean up to remove passing data forward: JUST Nav Controller & Segues (both kinds to show distinction)
    rr Passing Data Forward
    ll simple lab, passing data forward
    03 ADV: More Practice ... (Tasks Today)
      why are there TWO segues to the same Detail VC? Also, for an advanced lab it might nice to have more than two VCs, to show how a Nav Controller handles a stack of at least three VCs. Not sure what example case would be good before Table Views, though.
