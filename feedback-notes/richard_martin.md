## Richard G. Martin â€” Feedback Notes

#### Notes from Skype session, 11/19/2015 3pm

finished second half of the prework

challenging, hard, well presented
being "stretched", sometimes a little too much
sometimes the challenge is a big jump from the written material
data structures, esp dictionaries
relying on Rypress
what methods do I use?
default fall back to if/else statement, structured programming
what about methods to leverage

collections practice
--> location trivia felt a lot easier
shows literal notation (subscripting)
labs are more about manipulating the data than entering it
required a lot of persistence to complete

did have to reference the solution in collections 11 & 12

really stands out among online learning options
"one of the best out there"
more progressive challenges for NSDictionary, fairly big jump
