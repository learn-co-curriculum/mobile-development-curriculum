This repository is for holding notes about the Mobile-Development-with-iOS curriculum track. It's primary purpose is to collate notes about problems with content (readings and instructions), though technical problems with labs may be appropriate if they are internal problems with the functioning of the lab itself or with student experience (e.g. please report needed CocoaPod updates such as KIF deprecations).
