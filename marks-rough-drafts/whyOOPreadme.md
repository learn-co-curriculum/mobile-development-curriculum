## A Brief History of Run Time

Numbers, arithmetic, and counting currency and goods can be traced throughout human history. The earliest counting was done on human fingers and toes, which is the meaning held by *digitus*, the Latin root of *digit*. The pervasiveness of the [decimal system][decimal] (base ten) in human society owes itself to our very biology: ten fingers and ten toes.

##### Ancient Calculators

The earliest counting devices used boards with beads, or [knots in lengths of ropes][inca_quipu]. The most recognized of these ancient counting tools is the [abacus][abacus_wiki]. While it's English name is derived from the Greek, it's believed that the abacus originated in Mesopotamia and is still widely used by merchants in Africa and Asia.

##### The Hindu-Arabic Numeral System

The [Hindu-Arabic numeral system][hindu-arabic], the origin of the familiar shapes of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, is now the most widely used number system in the world. This, however, was a long time in coming. Developed by the 4th Century CE, [Islamic mathematicians][islamic_mathematics] were introduced to it around 825 CE with the first undisputed use of a symbol for zero dated at 876 CE.

While [Gerbert d'Aurillac][pope_sylvester_ii] (later Pope Sylvester II), encountered and studied the Arabic numerals staring in 967 CE, it was [Leonardo Fibonacci][fibonacci] who is credited with bringing the system to Europe through his publication *Liber Abaci* in 1202 CE. By the 15th Century CE, "Arabic", as the system was called in Europe, replaced the [Roman numerals][roman_numerals] in the common use.

##### Mechanical Calculators and The Difference Engine

In 1642, the French mathematician [Blaise Pascal][pascal] invented a mechanical counting machine to facilitate his father's tax accounting. Pascal's machine had a reliable carry function and was the only working [mechanical calculator][mechanical_calculator] in the 17th Century.

A few decades later, inspired by the news of Pascal's calculator but without direct influence, the German polymath and philosopher [Gottfried Leibniz][leibniz] worked on a calculator that also performed multiplication using a [stepped drum][leibniz_wheel] mechanism. However, he wasn't able to make it fully functional in his lifetime and it wasn't until the 19th Century that working [arithmometers][arithmometer] were mass produced.

It was in this era that Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace attempted to create a programmable mechanical computer called The Difference Engine.

##### The Binary System

Inspired by the *I, Ching*, [Gottfried Leibniz][leibniz] in 1679 was the first to mathematically study the [binary system][binary] (base two) which modern computing is based in. Later, in the early 19th Century, [George Boole][george_boole] would use binary (true and false) to develop an algebraic system of logic which became known as [Boolean algebra][boolean_algebra]. Boolean algebra allowed the development of [logic gates][logic_gates], which are implemented in computer circuits using either [diodes][diodes] (such as vacuum tubes) or [transistors][transistors].
